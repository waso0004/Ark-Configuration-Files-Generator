# ARK: Survival Ascended Server Configuration Generator

This is a simple web tool that helps you generate ARK: Survival Ascended server config files without manually editing INI files.

It focuses on the two files:

- `GameUserSettings.ini`
- `Game.ini`

## What it does

- Shows server settings in an organized UI
- Lets you change values and then export your config
- Can import existing INI files so you can tweak your current setup
- Saves your changes in your browser so you can come back later

## Where the settings come from

The setting names and placement are based on:

- ARK Official Community Wiki (Server configuration):
	https://ark.wiki.gg/wiki/Server_configuration
- Official ASA patch notes (for settings that are not listed on the wiki yet):
	https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/forums/topic/708761-asa-pc-patch-notes-client-v7715-server-v7715-updated12202025/

## Notes

- This project is not affiliated with Studio Wildcard.
- Some settings are newer and may only be documented in patch notes.
